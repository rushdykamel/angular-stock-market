# Angular Stock Market

This project was build in Angular which uses free public stock market APIs 

Thanks to https://www.alphavantage.co/ for the APIs

The app shows real-life stock data for 8 companies, shown in tables and charts (using chart.js and ng2-chart)

## How to run

Run `npm install`, if needed add `--legacy-peer-deps`

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
